<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Shaun</h1>
<h3 align="center">Full-Stack Developer | Problem-Solver | Lifelong Learner</h3>

---

I'm a South African developer who thrives on solving real-world problems with code. My approach is pragmatic, results-driven, and focused on building scalable, maintainable solutions that deliver value.

Whether it's creating seamless front-end experiences or structuring robust back-end systems, I bring a strong foundation in **JavaScript (React, Node.js)** and **PostgreSQL**, with a growing interest in **Python** for automation and deeper problem-solving.

---

### 🧠 How I Think

- **Developer Mindset**: I build with users in mind, write clean code, and always question: *“Will this scale? Will this break? Can it be better?”*
- **Problem Solver**: I enjoy breaking down messy challenges into clear, manageable pieces—whether debugging code or rethinking a feature.
- **Growth-Driven**: I learn fast, seek feedback constantly, and ship often. I believe in learning by doing, failing forward, and iteration over perfection.

---

### 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, DevKinsta
- **Currently Exploring**: Python, C#, WordPress (for client-based delivery)

### 🚀 Projects Highlight
